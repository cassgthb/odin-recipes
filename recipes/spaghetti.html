    <h3>Description from Wikipedia:</h3>

    <p>
        Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. 
        It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, 
        spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins 
        and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina. 
        The pasta is usually white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour 
        may be added.
